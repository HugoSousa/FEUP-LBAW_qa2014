	<p> We encourage yout to look around to see if your question has been asked before. </p>
	<p> It is also acceptable to ask and answer your own question. </p>
	<p> Questions which are too broad, unclear, incomplete or primarily opinion-based may be put on hold or even reported by the community until they are improved.	</p>

	<p> First off, we encourage you to search and research our website to see if someone already had a problem similar to yours. </p>
	<p> If you can't find anything useful, pretend you're talking to a busy colleague and have to sum up your entire question in one sentence: </p>
	<p> what details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem? </p> 
	<p> Include any error messages, key APIs, or unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions already on the site. </p>
	<p> Spelling, grammar and punctuation are important! Remember, this is the first part of your question others will see - you want to make a good impression. </p>
	<p> Here are some guidelines: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> The title should sumarize the problem </li>
		<li> Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce the problem. For help with this, read How to create a Minimal, Complete, Valid Example. </li>
		<li> Include all relevant tags [for the language, library, and specific API your question relates to] </li>
		<li> Proof-read before posting! </li>
	</ul>
	<p> After posting your question <p>
	<ul>
		<li> Post the question and respond to feedback </li>
		<li> Be on-topic </li>
		<li> Be specific </li>
		<li> Make it relevant to others </li>
	</ul>
	<p> At last, don't forget to keep an open mind. </p>
	<p> The answer to your question may not always be the one you wanted, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is wrong. A conclusive answer isn&#39;t always possible. When in doubt, ask people to cite their sources, or to explain how/where they learned something. Even if we don&#39;t agree with you, or tell you exactly what you wanted to hear, remember: we&#39;re just trying to help.</p>

	<p> You should avoid asking questions that are </p> 
	<p> <b> Duplicate </b>  - The question has already been asked before and has an answer. </p>
	<p> <b> Off topic </b> - This question does not appear to be about programming within the scope defined by the community. Consider editing the question or leaving comments for improvement if you believe the question can be reworded to fit within the scope.</p>
	<p> <b> Unclear </b> - Please clarify your specific problem or provide additional details to highlight exactly what you need. The way the question is currenty written, it's hard to tell exactly what you're asking.</p>
	<p> <b> Too broad </b> - if your question could be answered by an entire book, or has many valid answers, it's probably too broad for our format. Please add details to narrow down the answer set or to isolate an issue that can be answered in a few paragraphs.</p>
	<p> <b> Primarily opinion-based </b> - Many good questions generate some degree of opinion based on expert experience, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than on facts, references, or specific expertise.    </p>

	<p>A <b>tag</b> is a word or phrase that describes the topic of the question. Tags are a means of connecting experts with questions they will be able to answer by sorting questions into specific, well-defined categories.</p>
	<p> Tags can also be used to help you identify questions that are interesting or relevant to you. </p>
	<p> By clicking on the button 'tags' you will be redirected to a page listing all the tags used in this website. </p>
	<p> Clicking on a tag below a question brings you to a page that shows all questions within that tag.  </p>

	<p> The first thing you should do when someone answers your question is vote on it, like any other user does. Vote up answers that are helpful and well-researched, and vote down answers that are not. Other users will also vote on answers to your question. </p>
	<p> As the author of the question, you have an additional option: accepting an answer that you believe is the best solution to your problem. </p>
	<p> To accept an answer: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Choose one answer that you believe is the best solution to your problem. </li>
		<li> To mark an answer as accepted, click on the check mark beside the answer to toggle it from greyed out to filled in. </li>
		<li> You may change which answer is accepted, or simply un-accept the answer, at any time. </li>
	</ul>
	<p> Accepting an answer is not mandatory; do not feel compelled to accept the first answer you receive. Wait until you receive an answer that answers your question well.</p>      </div>

	<p> To get better answers, you may need to put additional effort into your question. Edit your question to provide status and progress updates.  </p>

	<p> Reputation is a rough measurement of how much the community trusts you; it is earned by convincing your peers that you know what you&#39;re talking about. Basic use of the site, including asking and answering, questions does not require any reputation at all </p>
	<p> The primary way to gain reputation is by posting good questions and useful answers. Votes on these posts cause you to gain (or sometimes lose) reputation. </p>
	<p> You gain reputation when: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> question is voted up: +2 points </li>
		<li> answer is voted up: +10 points </li>
 		<li> answer is marked &quot;accepted&quot;: +15 points </li>
	</ul>
	<p> You lose reputation when: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> your question is voted down: -2 points </li>
		<li> you answer is voted down: -2 </li>
		<li> answer is unmarked &quot;accepted&quot;: -15 points </li>
	</ul>
	<p> All users start with 0 reputation points, and reputation can never be negative.  Accepting your own answer does not gain you any reputation. If a user reverses a vote, the corresponding reputation loss or gain will be reversed as well. </p>
